Welcome to the Project Pi Labs GitHub 🔨

**Project Pi Labs** is an Atlanta-based studio dedicated to building secure, yield-generating blockchain infrastructure through validators, liquid staking, and decentralized AI solutions. Originally developed to support our own internal protocols, our infrastructure has evolved into tailored, real-world solutions designed explicitly for founders, communities, and institutions. Leveraging decentralized artificial intelligence, transparent collaboration, and scalable blockchain validation, Project Pi Labs empowers trusted ecosystems, fostering innovation and reliable, efficient yields at scale.

## 🧑🏽‍🚀 About Project Pi

Project Pi is a liquid-staking protocol built to make staking as secure and decentralized as possible. As a family of open-source, peer-to-system software tools, Project Pi is currently deployed and  on the PulseChain blockchain network.

The Project Pi protocol is governed by the Pi DAO - an independent collection of contributors, staking enthusiasts and governance participants 🧑🏽‍🚀
